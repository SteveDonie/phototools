    <h4> MakeAlbum Command line syntax:</h4>
    <pre>MakeAlbum [-PhotoDir directory] [-AlbumDir directory]
          [-BigSize number] [-SmallSize number] [-Quality .NN] [-SkipNoWeb] [-MainPage filename] 
          [-Title WebPageTitle] [-noPause] [-cleanHTML]</pre>
    <h4> Parameters:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
PhotoDir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the full drive and directory path to where the original photos are stored. Subdirectories under this directory will result in
web pages being created for each subdirectory. You
can name subdirectories however you like, but if you name them using the form YYYY-MM (year and month) then the web pages will be in order by year and month and they will have
nice names like &quot;October 1967&quot; for a directory named 1967-10.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
AlbumDir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the full drive and directory path to where the Web Album will be initially created.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
BigSize&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the largest dimension (in pixels) for the large size of photo on the web site.
I use 600, but you may want to use a smaller number so that the pages fit better
on small screens, or to reduce the overall file size of your website. If your web
hosting provider only gives you 15 MB of space, you will probably want to use a
smaller number than if you have 300MB!&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
SmallSize&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the largest dimension (in pixels) for the small thumbnails on the website. 200 is a good number here.
Again, reducing the size will reduce the file size of your album.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
Quality&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the JPEG compression quality to use. If you do not specify
a value, then .75 will be used, which is a good balance between
file size and quality. Valid numbers are from 0.0 to 1.0, with
1.0 meaning no compression, highest quality.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
SkipNoWeb&nbsp;&nbsp; is either yes or no, to control whether directories with a file named NoWeb.txt are used in the web photo album. By default, this is 'yes'.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
MainPage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the name of the file to create for the main 'index' page.
Title is the title that will be placed into the titlebar of the web browser when people view your pages. It is also used on the pages themselves.
The name should be something like &quot;PhotoIndex.html&quot;. See the note
below about -cleanHTML for reasons why.</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the Title for the web page - this is what will be displayed in the title bar
of the browser.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">noPause&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    indicates that the program should not
pause (useful if calling from another batch file).&nbsp;I have this set up on my
own machine to make 3 different albums - one for my intranet, where I have
almost unlimited web storage space, one for Tripod, and one for GeoCities. I can
update all 3 at once by running &quot;3Albums.bat -nopause&quot;. I have
included 3Albums.bat and the other batch files I use in the zip file as an
example. By default, this is off.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">cleanHTML&nbsp;&nbsp; When
    MakeAlbum runs, it creates many HTML formatted files - some for the index
    pages, and some for the individual photo pages. One strange convention I
    have come up with is that the index pages have an extension of .html, and
    the photo pages have an extension of .htm. Specifying -cleanHTML on the
    command line causes all the index pages to be deleted and re-created, which
    is useful if you add a new directory of photos, so that the indexes for each
    directory get re-created as well. By default, this is off, but I have it set
    in MyAlbum.bat to be always on. It doesn't take very long to re-create these
    files or to upload them - the only thing is to be careful that other files
    don't get deleted by accident.<br>
    <font color="#FF0000"><b>WARNING:</b> If you have created other .html files, they will also be
    deleted, unless you mark them read-only!!<br>
    </font>To make a file read-only, right-click on it and select
    &quot;Properties&quot;, then check the read-only box.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
-?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shows this file.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-indent: -90; margin-left: 90">
-help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shows more extensive help and tips.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please note that the preferred way of setting parameters is by creating a file
named MyAlbum.bat, based on the MyAlbumSample.bat included with the
distribution. Here is what that file looks like:
</p>
<pre>@echo off
REM -------------------- Change settings here if you want to -------------------
SET PhotosDir=E:\Photos
SET AlbumDir=E:\Album
SET BigSize=600
SET SmallSize=200
SET PhotoQuality=.75
SET SkipNoWeb=yes
SET MainPageName=PhotoIndex.html
SET PageTitle=Donie Web Photo Album
SET AlbumNoPause=
SET CleanHTML=</pre>

<p>
As you can see, the names in MyAlbum.bat may be slightly different from those specified on the command line (i.e. AlbumNoPause vs.
-noPause), but the effects are the same as described above.
