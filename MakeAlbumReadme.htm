<h1>Instructions for using MakeAlbum</h1>
<h4>

Overview</h4>
<p>

This program creates Web Photo Albums based on an existing directory of
photos. A Web Photo Album consists of an initial web page with a name that 
you specify (I call mine PhotoIndex.html) that has links to other web pages, 
one per subdirectory under the main Photos directory. All the photos have to 
be in the JPEG format, with an extension of .JPG
The other web pages each have links like the main page (to the
other pages), and also have thumbnails of each photo that link to a larger
version of each photo. To see an example of this in action, surf over to <a href="http://stevedonie.tripod.com/">http://stevedonie.tripod.com/</a></p>
<p>

The work here is done by a variety of methods. A Perl program does most of the work, so if you don't have Perl installed, it won't work. See the
link just below for instructions on installing Perl. There
is a little Java program to create the resized pictures, so you need to have Java
installed - it also uses a feature only in Java 1.4, so make sure you get a
recent version. I've also supplied a batch file to start things off on a
DOS/Windows machine. It should probably work on other machines that have Perl
and Java, but I've never tested that.</p>
<p>

 To install a Perl interpreter for Windows, I recommend
ActivePerl, which is free. You can get it from <a href="http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/">http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/</a>&nbsp;<br>
 Installing
it using the default settings will be fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Most machines these days already have Java on them, but if you get errors while
running this, you can get the Sun JRE (Java Runtime Environment) for free from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/jre/download-windows.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/jre/download-windows.html</a>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
Installation:</h4>
<p>
The self-extracting zip file should extract the files needed to the directory
you specify. By default, this is C:\MakeAlbum, but
feel free to change this to anything you want. The zip file will create 2
directories under the main one, one named PhotoTools, the other named Photos.
The PhotoTools directory has the program files, the Photos directory is
initially empty (this is where it wants to keep photos by default). After the files are extracted,
there are a couple of steps before you create your first album.</p>
<ol>
  <li>You will have to at least tell the program where your photos are, and
    where to make your Web Album. There are only 12 different settings to
    change, so it's not hard to customize how the program works. You can do this
    by editing the file 'AlbumSettings.default' or by copying that file to some
    other name. I have three different versions of my photo album, so I have
    three files - AlbumSettings.tripod, AlbumSettings.geocities, and
    AlbumSettings.lonestar. <a href="MakeAlbumSyntax.htm">See the syntax page</a>
    for more details on what options are available. If you don't do anything, it
    should still work right out of the box, if you have your directories set up
    like I have mine set up.</li>
  <li>Next, make sure that the directory where all your photos are kept is set
    up like the program expects. The way the program was designed to be used is that you have a
    main directory (like <a href="file:///c:/photos">C:\MakeAlbum\photos</a>) that
    contains a number of subdirectories. These should only be one level deep.
    The directories can be named anything you like, but I like to keep mine by
    year and month, so most of mine have names like &quot;2000-01&quot;, etc.
    Naming them this way, with the year first, keeps them all in order. See the
    Tips section below for more directory naming ideas.</li>
  <li>If you want to put captions on your photos, there are 2 ways to do it. The
    first is to rename the files to have caption-like names. To keep them in
    order, you can have names that start with a number, and then space, dash,
    space, and the caption.&nbsp;<br>
    The second, more powerful way, is to have a caption file for each photo. The
    name of the caption file is the same as the name of the photo, but with a
    .txt extension instead of .jpg - so for the file 02032501.jpg, you create a
    file 02032501.txt. That text file has 3 sections. It looks like this:<br>
    <font face="Courier New">&lt;!-- THUMBSPART:caption --><br>
    The Bulletin Board!&nbsp;<br>
    &lt;!-- THUMBSPART:comment --><br>
    We only got one put up, and we didn't&nbsp;<br>
    quite finish the roofing, but I think it looks&nbsp;<br>
    &lt;b&gt;MAHVELOUS!&lt;b&gt;<br>
    &lt;!-- THUMBSPART:name --><br>
    this is not used<br>
    </font>To make this easy, download a program that was written to work with a
    similar web album called Thumbs. <a href="http://www.greggman.com/thumbs/shellext.htm">http://www.greggman.com/thumbs/shellext.htm</a><br>
    You can even put HTML codes inside the captions and comments if you want to.
    The program will use the captions under each photo on the thumbnail index
    pages, and also on the page that shows the photos in their larger size. The
    coment will only be shown under the larger size photos, and I currently
    don't use the name at all.</li>
  <li>Now you can try making your Web Album. Open up a command prompt (DOS
    Window) and change to the directory where you you unzipped everything, and
    then type &quot;makealbum&quot; to start it going. When you are done, you
    will have a local copy of your web photo album in the directory you
    specified. If you keep things set up with the defaults, the album will be at
    <a href="file:///C:/MakeAlbum/WebAlbum/PhotoIndex.html">C:\MakeAlbum\WebAlbum\PhotoIndex.html</a>
    You can test your
    website out by opening the &quot;PhotoIndex.html&quot; page that was created
    by the program. After you have tested it, you will probably want to upload
    it to a webserver somewhere - see the section on uploading below for a neat
    way to do this.</li>
</ol>

Using the program:</h4>

 <a href="MakeAlbumSyntax.htm">See the syntax page</a> for more
details on how to do things either way.</p>

<h4>

Some Tips:&nbsp;</h4>

<p>

You can use strange characters (including space,~!@#$%) that are legal 
in Windows filenames in the original photo and directory names. These
characters will be stripped out in the names of files and directories for
the web album since many web servers are UNIX-based and won't accept the 
strange characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

For photo names, you can use the strange characters to have 'caption-
like' names for your photos, and these original caption-like names will be 
used as captions on the web pages. Note that '!' is a legal DOS filename
character, but '?' is not. Not much I can do about that.</p>

<p>

To make photos in a directory show up on the web page in a certain order, you
can name the photos like this:</p>

<pre>    1001 - Picture of me.jpg 
    1234 - Another picture.jpg </pre>

<p>

If you do this, the captions will have the number and ' - ' stripped out, 
as well as the extension, so for the example, the captions on the web page would be 
&quot;Picture of me&quot; and &quot;Another Picture&quot;, and the pictures will show up on the
web page in 
numerical order. For this to work, make sure that you have names that are all
digits, then space, dash, space, then the caption you want. Be careful though - if you have files
with names that start 1 through
10, 10 will show up before 2 unless you name them 01, 02, to 10. It isn't
a numerical sorting, but an alpha-numeric sorting that happens.</p>

<p>

For directory names, you can use the strange characters to force the links 
in the web pages to be in a certain order, instead of in the normal order, 
which is typically alphabetical, with numbers appearing before letters.
Many of the special characters come even earlier in the sorting order than
numbers, so by using them as the first character of a directory or file 
name, you can affect the order of the pages in the album or the photos on
a page.&nbsp;Here's the sorting order that the program uses:</p>

<p>

 !"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmno<br>
pqrstuvwxyz{|}~&#8962;ÇüéâäàåçêëèïîìÄÅÉæÆôöòûùÿÖÜ¢£¥&#8359;ƒáíóúñÑªº¿&#8976;¬½¼¡«»&#9617;&#9618;&#9619;&#9474;&#9508;&#9569;&#9570;&#9558;&#9557;&#9571;&#9553;&#9559;&#9565;&#9564;&#9563;&#9488;<br>
&#9492;&#9524;&#9516;&#9500;&#9472;&#9532;&#9566;&#9567;&#9562;&#9556;&#9577;&#9574;&#9568;&#9552;&#9580;&#9575;&#9576;&#9572;&#9573;&#9561;&#9560;&#9554;&#9555;&#9579;&#9578;&#9496;&#9484;&#9608;&#9604;&#9612;&#9616;&#9600;&#945;ß&#915;&#960;&#931;&#963;µ&#964;&#934;&#920;&#937;&#948;&#8734;&#966;&#949;&#8745;&#8801;±&#8805;&#8804;&#8992;&#8993;÷&#8776;°&#8729;·&#8730;&#8319;²&#9632; </p>

<p>

If you don't want a certain directory in the original Photos directory to be 
included in the web photo album, just create an empty text file named 
&quot;NoWeb.txt&quot; in that directory. This is great if your web server is a limited 
size, or if you have directories you just don't want posted. You can override
this by setting the SkipNoWeb parameter on the command line or in this batch 
file. Of course, to exclude multiple directories you can just copy that file
to each directory to exclude.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>

Uploading your web site</h4>

<p>
Recently I discovered a neat program that I use to update my web sites once I have created
them on my computer. The program is called sitecopy, and is available for free from 
the author. What it does is synchronize a directory on your machine with your web site
using the FTP protocol. Very nice, as it just updates the things that have changed.
You can get it here: <a href="http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/">http://www.lyra.org/sitecopy/</a><br>
Getting sitecopy set up was a little tricky - it was designed for Unix, and getting it working on Windows
took some time. You have to install something called CygWin, which makes some Unix commands available
in windows. CygWin is available (again, free) from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>&nbsp;

</p>

<p>
If you need some help contact either me or the author of those
programs.

</p>

<p>If this sounds too daunting, you may want to just get one of the many fine
FTP programs available. I happen to like CuteFTP and FTPExplorer, which are
available at <a href="http://www.cuteftp.com">http://www.cuteftp.com</a> and <a href="http://www.ftpx.com">http://www.ftpx.com</a>,
respectively.

</p>

<p>As far web hosting, there are many options there, too. I am using Tripod,
which currently offers 50MB of web space for free, plus an easy-to-remember
domain name like <a href="http://stevedonie.tripod.com">http://stevedonie.tripod.com</a>&nbsp;
